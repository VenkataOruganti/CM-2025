In blouse making, proper dart placement is crucial for achieving that custom-fitted look. This guide covers everything you need to know about dart positioning.\n\n## What Are Darts?\n\nA dart is a tapered, stitched fold that removes excess fabric and creates shape. The dart point should end near the fullest part of the curve it shapes, but never directly on it.\n\n**Key Components:**\n- Dart legs: The two stitching lines\n- Dart point: Where the legs meet (the apex)\n- Dart intake: The amount of fabric taken in\n\n## Types of Darts in Blouses\n\n### Bust Darts\n\n**Side Bust Dart (Horizontal)**\n- Most common in saree blouses\n- Starts from side seam, points toward bust apex\n- Creates fitted waist while accommodating bust\n\n**French Dart (Angled)**\n- Starts from lower side seam\n- Runs diagonally toward bust\n- Elegant, slimming effect\n\n**Shoulder Dart (Vertical)**\n- Runs from shoulder down toward bust\n- Good for smaller bust sizes\n- Creates clean front appearance\n\n### Waist Darts\n\n**Back Waist Darts**\n- Create fitted back\n- Usually positioned at quarter and three-quarter points\n- Essential for hourglass silhouette\n\n**Front Waist Darts**\n- Shape the front below bust\n- Work with bust darts for complete shaping\n- May be eliminated in princess seam designs\n\n## The Apex Point\n\nThe bust apex is the fullest point of the bust. All bust-shaping darts should point toward but stop before this point.\n\n**Finding the Apex:**\n- Measure from shoulder to bust point\n- Measure from center front to bust point\n- These measurements give you apex coordinates\n\n**Important Rule:**\n- Dart should end 1 to 1.5 inches before apex\n- Ending at apex creates a pointed, unflattering look\n- Ending too far from apex leaves fabric loose\n\n## Dart Placement by Body Type\n\n### Small Bust (A-B Cup)\n- Smaller dart intake (0.5 to 1 inch)\n- Single dart often sufficient\n- Shoulder dart works well\n- Dart ends 1 inch from apex\n\n### Medium Bust (C Cup)\n- Moderate dart intake (1 to 1.5 inches)\n- Side bust dart is ideal\n- Dart ends 1.25 inches from apex\n- May need slight waist shaping\n\n### Full Bust (D+ Cup)\n- Larger dart intake (1.5 to 2.5 inches)\n- Consider two darts or princess seams\n- French dart distributes shaping well\n- Dart ends 1.5 inches from apex\n\n### High Bust\n- Position dart higher on side seam\n- Apex measurement from shoulder is shorter\n- Dart angle may be more horizontal\n\n### Low Bust\n- Position dart lower on side seam\n- Apex measurement from shoulder is longer\n- Dart angle may be more diagonal\n\n## Common Dart Placement Mistakes\n\n### Mistake 1: Dart Pointing Too High\n**Problem:** Creates pulling above bust, gaping below\n**Solution:** Lower the dart on side seam\n\n### Mistake 2: Dart Pointing Too Low\n**Problem:** Pulling below bust, loose above\n**Solution:** Raise the dart on side seam\n\n### Mistake 3: Dart Too Long\n**Problem:** Pointed, unflattering bust appearance\n**Solution:** Shorten dart by 0.5 to 1 inch\n\n### Mistake 4: Dart Too Short\n**Problem:** Loose fabric around bust\n**Solution:** Lengthen dart toward apex\n\n### Mistake 5: Wrong Dart Intake\n**Problem:** Too tight or too loose fit\n**Solution:** Adjust dart width based on bust measurement\n\n## Transferring Darts\n\nSometimes you need to move dart position for design purposes. The dart can be rotated to different locations while maintaining the same shaping effect.\n\n**Possible Dart Positions:**\n- Shoulder\n- Neckline\n- Center front\n- Side seam (most common)\n- Armhole\n- Waist\n\n**Transfer Method:**\n- Draw line from new position to apex\n- Close original dart\n- New dart opens at new position\n- Same amount of fabric is taken in\n\n## Princess Seams as Dart Alternative\n\nFor larger busts or design preference, princess seams replace darts entirely.\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Smoother shaping over curves\n- No dart points visible\n- More design possibilities\n- Better for full bust\n\n**When to Use:**\n- Bust dart would be very large\n- Customer prefers seamless look\n- Design calls for panels\n\n## Pressing Darts\n\nProper pressing is essential for professional results.\n\n**Bust Darts:**\n- Press toward waist (downward)\n- Use tailor's ham for shaping\n- Do not press fold beyond dart point\n\n**Waist Darts:**\n- Press toward center (front or back)\n- Keep dart flat and smooth\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDart placement is both science and art. Understanding body geometry helps you position darts correctly, while experience teaches you to adjust for individual variations. Master this skill, and your blouses will consistently achieve that coveted custom-fit look.\n\nCuttingMaster automatically calculates optimal dart positions based on customer measurements. Our patterns take the guesswork out of dart placement while allowing you to make adjustments as needed."
